## Key Architectural Changes

### Current Issues Identified
- **Black-Scholes Fallback Calculations** (alpaca_client.py:274-323)
- **Mock Greeks and Volatility** (hardcoded values)
- **Data Source Mixing** (real + calculated in same response)
- **Inconsistent Error Handling** (silent fallbacks to calculations)

### Proposed Solutions
- **Pure Alpaca Data Layer**: Zero fallback logic, real data only
- **Fail-Fast Error Handling**: Structured errors when data unavailable
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Multi-layer data integrity checks
- **Transparent Source Attribution**: Clear data source tracking

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Real Data Only Policy
- ✅ All data sourced from Alpaca APIs
- ❌ No Black-Scholes calculations
- ❌ No mock or theoretical pricing
- ✅ Clear error responses when data unavailable

### 2. Data Integrity First
- ✅ Cryptographic verification where possible
- ✅ Immutable source data (never modified)
- ✅ Complete audit trail
- ✅ Source attribution on all responses

### 3. Fail-Fast Architecture
- ✅ Early detection of data unavailability
- ✅ Structured error responses
- ✅ No silent failures or fallbacks
- ✅ Circuit breaker protection

### 4. Performance with Integrity
- ✅ Intelligent caching (real data only)
- ✅ Dynamic TTL based on market conditions
- ✅ Connection pooling and optimization
- ✅ Comprehensive monitoring
